<p>When you use Git to manage your code changes, you create a
   directory on your local computer for each branch that you
   wish to work with.  This is in addition to the set files that
   exist at github.com.</p>
<ul>
<li>When you execute the git commands from the command line 
    in the shell, you should have the current directory set
    to the root of the file system on your laptop.</li>
<li>When you use an IDE such as Eclipse, you should not have the
    local files within the directory structure that the IDE uses by 
    default.  You will then specify the directory containing in the
    files within the IDE.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once you have made changes to the files, the following procedure
   will move the changes to the copy at github.com.</p>
<ul>
<li>Set the current directory to the root of the file system for the
    branch.</li>
<li>The command <code>git add .</code> will insure that all of the files
    are marked for management.</li>
<li>The command <code>git commit -a -m "my comments"</code> will
    locate all of the modified files and mark them as committed.  The text
    after the <code>-m</code> operator will become the message Git 
    uses to describe the commit.</li>
<li>To move all of the changes to the copy on github.com, you will 
    execute the command <code>git push origin <i>branch</i></code>
    where <i>branch</i> is the name of the branch to be processed.
    On my system, the branches are <i>master</i> for the project
    and <i>gh-pages</i> for the documentation.</li>
</ul>
<p>To create the documentation for the GitHub site, you need to do the following.</p>
<ul>
<li>Clone a copy of your GitHub project at a new location on your workstation.</li>
<li>Set the current directory to the root folder of this new clone.</li>
<li>Use the git command to change the branch to gh-pages with the <i>orphan</i> setting.</li>
<li>Delete all of the files in the gh-pages branch.</li>
<li>Insert the files that make up your documentation site.</li>
<li>Mark all of the files as being tracked by git.</li>
<li>Commit the set of files.</li>
<li>Push the gh-pages branch back to the project on GitHub.</li>
</ul>
