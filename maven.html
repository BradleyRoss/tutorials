  <h1>Maven Usage</h1>
  <h2>Javadocs</h2>
  <p>Tags were placed in the pom file for the parent module to set the <code>quiet</code> 
     and <code>linksource</code> parameters to true.</p>
  <h2>Maven Dependencies</h2>
  <p>When creating the project, I ran into some problems because of the dependencies in the Maven pom files.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Version 2.10.3 of maven-javadoc-plugin has a dependency on version 2.2.1 of maven-core, which in turn
        has dependencies on slf4j-nop and slf4j-jdk14.  This caused problems when using the
        tutorials-common jar file in multiple environments.  A dependency on version 3.3.9 of maven-core
        was placed in the parent module.  Since version 3.3.9 didn't have these undesired dependencies,
        that solved the problem.</li>
    <li>Version 2.10.3 of  maven-javadoc-plugin also has a dependency on the log4j artifact, causing
        another problem when dealing with multiple logging frameworks.  The dependency tag for maven-javadoc-plugin
        in the tutorials-common module was modified to exclude the logj4 artifact.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Maven Goals</h1>
  <p>The following Maven goals are used with this project.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><code>clean</code>  -- This removes files generated by previous Maven tasks.</li>
    <li><code>compile</code> -- This compiles all of the Java code found in the module.</li>
    <li><code>javadoc:javadoc</code> -- This generates the Javadocs for the module and places them
        in the <code>site/apidocs</code> directory.</li>
    <li><code>dependency:copy-dependencies</code> -- This places the jar files that
        represent the dependencies for the module in the <code>site</code> direcory.</li>
    <li><code>dependency:purge-local-repository</code></li>
    <li><code>package</code> -- This creates the jar or war file that is the final product of the module.</li>
  </ul>
