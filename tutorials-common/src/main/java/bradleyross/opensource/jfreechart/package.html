<p>Examples using JFreeChart, an open-source library for plotting graphs of various types.</p>
<p>The web site for this package is located at 
   <a href="http://www.jfree.org" target="jfree">http://www.jfree.org</a>.</p>
<p>The Javadocs's for the various libraries are at the following locations.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>JFreeChart <a href="http://www.jfree.org/jfreechart/api/javadoc" target="jfree">
       http://www.jfree.org/jfreechart/api/javadoc</a></p></li>
<li><p>JCommon <a href="http://www.jfree.org/jcommon/api" target="jfree">
       http://www.jfree.org/jcommon/api</a></p></li>
</ul>
<p>Some of the methods used in this package are deprecated.  However, I
   have suppressed deprecation warnings.</p>
<p>There is a demonstration of the various chart types in the
   file <code>jfreechart-1.0.10-demo.jar</code>.  This program can
   be execued by either of the following methods.</p>
<h3>Demonstration</h3>
<ul>
<li><p><code>java -jar jfreechart-1.0.10-demo.jar</code></p></li>
<li><p><code>java -classpath jfreechart-1.0.10-demo.jar demo.SuperDemo</code></p></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Warning:</b> The programs in the file jfreechart-1.0.10-demo.jar
      dynamically load the contents
      of other jar files.  That means that the directories must be in the
      same relative file locations as in the download from the JFree site.</p>
<h3>Platform dependence</h3>
<p>This library uses SWT (Standard Widget Toolkit from
   <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/swt" target="swt">Eclipse Foundation</a>)
   graphics, which are platform dependent.  Versions are
   available for Apple Macintosh and Windows as well as a version that should be
   platform dependent but is described as being a little slower.  If it is used in
   applets (programs run on the browser in the same way as Flash or ShockWave), it
   may be necessary to have three versions on the web site, although this would
   be transparent to users.</p>
<p>If used in servlets (programs that run on the server), the swt.jar file for the
   appropriate platform should be placed in the <code>lib</code> directory, which
   is used for all applications on the server.</p>
