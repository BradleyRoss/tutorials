		<p>Javadocs for the Java classes that are common to all of the submodules in the tutorials.</p>
		<p>See the file pom.xml in pom-tutorials-parent to see how the parameters are set for the Javadocs.  The
		   items in this Javadoc link to the source code and it also provides links to the Javadocs for
		   the other jar files listed in the dependencies.</p>
		<p>The field, constructor, and method names in the summary sections link to the descriptions in the
		   detail sections.  The names in the detail sections link to the source code.</p>
		<p>You can place additional material for the Javadocs in the Maven project.  The text for
			these additional comments are placed in
			<code>src/main/javadoc/overview.html</code>.  See
			<a href="http://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-javadoc-plugin/javadoc-mojo.html" target="_blank">
			http://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-javadoc-plugin/javadoc-mojo.html</a>
			for more information.

		<p>Some of this code is over ten years old and it needs some cleaning up.  Classes may move between
		   packages during the cleanup since this is considered more instructional than a usable library.</p>
